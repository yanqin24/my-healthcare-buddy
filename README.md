## Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Import the project into your IDE as a Maven project
2. Ensure JDK 11 is configured
3. Run the Main class (com.healthbuddy.Main)

## Troubleshooting

1. Database Connection Issues
   - Check if the data directory exists
   - Ensure write permissions are set correctly

2. Display Issues
   - Verify Java version compatibility
   - Check system look and feel settings
